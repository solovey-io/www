                <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy explains how Bootstrap Pro (referred to as "I", "me", or "my service") collects, uses, and shares information when you use my consulting services or visit this website. By using my services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
                </p>

                <h2>INFORMATION I COLLECT</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you contact me via the form, I collect your name and email address. If we proceed with consulting, I may collect further details relevant to your business needs, such as company name, business goals, and operational details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> I may collect information on how the website is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of my website that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This is typically collected via standard web server logs and is used for website improvement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>HOW I USE INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>I use the collected data for various purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide and maintain my consulting services.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>
                    I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Personal Information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist me in operating my website, conducting my business, or serving you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. I may also release your information when I believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce my site policies, or protect my or others' rights, property, or safety.
                </p>

                <h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>
                <p>
                    The security of your data is important to me. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                </p>
