                <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Bootstrap Pro (referred to as "I", "me", or "my service"). By accessing or using my consulting services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.
                </p>

                <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
                <p>
                    By engaging my services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use my services.
                </p>

                <h2>SERVICES OFFERED</h2>
                <p>
                    I provide business consulting services aimed at helping entrepreneurs bootstrap their ventures with minimal external funding. Specific services, scope, and deliverables will be outlined in a separate agreement or proposal unique to each client engagement.
                </p>

                <h2>CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You agree to provide accurate and complete information necessary for the provision of services.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for implementing the strategies and advice provided. My service offers guidance; ultimate success depends on your execution.</li>
                    <li>You agree to make timely payments for services as outlined in our agreement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>PAYMENT TERMS</h2>
                <p>
                    Fees for my services will be clearly stated in the individual client agreement. Payment schedules and methods will also be detailed there. All fees are non-refundable once services have commenced, unless otherwise specified in writing.
                </p>

                <h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any materials, methodologies, or tools developed by me during the course of our engagement remain my intellectual property, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in a separate written agreement.</li>
                    <li>You retain all intellectual property rights to your existing business assets and any new creations developed independently by you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
                <p>
                    My services are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, express or implied. I do not guarantee specific outcomes, as business success involves many factors outside my control. My advice is based on my experience and best judgment, but it is not a guarantee of financial or operational success.
                </p>

                <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, I shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the services.
                </p>

                <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
                <p>
                    Either party may terminate the consulting engagement as per the terms outlined in our specific service agreement. Upon termination, you remain responsible for any outstanding fees for services rendered.
                </p>

                <h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction - e.g., the State of California], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                </p>

                <h2>CHANGES TO TERMS</h2>
                <p>
                    I reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, I will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at my sole discretion.
                </p>
